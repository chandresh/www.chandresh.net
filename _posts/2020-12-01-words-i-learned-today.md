Most of the times when I read fiction as well as non-fiction books, I understand the meaning of new/difficult words from context but don't think more about these. But I often find myself not able explain the meaning of the word to someone else. I recently changed my habit as an experiment and started noting the words where I have even a slight difficult in understanding and explaining meaning.

Here are four words that I came across recently:

Limpid: Clear. Example: He writes in a limpid style.

Prosaic: Not challenging. (Like prose rather than poetry). नीरस. 
Example: The title of your book is so prosaic that most people are going to walk right past it in the store.¹

Banality: Being banal (a thing that has no original creativity or spark²), Unoriginality. Triviality.

Riff: (_verb_) to speak for a long time on a particular subject, especially in a humorous way.<sup>3</sup> Example: We called the show Thinking Things Over, and much of the time we riffed.<sup>4</sup>

Pretentious: To pretend to be something you are not.<sup>5</sup> Someone or something that try to seem important or significant but they are not.<sup>6</sup>
<br>

Examples:

I, on the other hand, was hired to work in the bar upstairs, a faux upscale taproom with an English private club motif: leather fauteuils, pretentiously bound hardcovers in fake bookshelves, and port in the well. In a stroke of genius, the owners had baptized the place the Nineteenth Avenue Diner.<sup>7</sup>

It might feel that this process is sort of look like a waste of time. But while writing this article and finding correct images and examples for each word has certainly made those words store firmly on my memory.
