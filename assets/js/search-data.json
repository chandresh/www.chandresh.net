Most of the times when I read fiction as well as non-fiction books, I understand the meaning of new/difficult words from context but don’t think more about these. But I often find myself not able explain the meaning of the word to someone else. I recently changed my habit as an experiment and started noting the words where I have even a slight difficult in understanding and explaining meaning. . Here are four words that I came across recently: . Limpid: Clear. Example: He writes in a limpid style. . Photo by Maria Teneva on Unsplash . . Prosaic: Not challenging. (Like prose rather than poetry). नीरस. Example: The title of your book is so prosaic that most people are going to walk right past it in the store.¹ . Banality: Being banal (a thing that has no original creativity or spark⁵), Unoriginality. Triviality. . Riff: (verb) to speak for a long time on a particular subject, especially in a humorous way.² Example: We called the show Thinking Things Over, and much of the time we riffed.³ . Pretentious: To pretend to be something you are not.⁴ . You might feel that this process is sort of look like a waste of time but while writing this article and finding correct images and examples for each word has certainly made those words stored firmly on my mind. . . https://wordsinasentence.com/prosaic-in-a-sentence | https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/riff | The Best American Essays 2020 (https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Best_American_Essays_2020.html?id=9l_IDwAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2SJKCxTmrM | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogx1nnYSn_U |",
